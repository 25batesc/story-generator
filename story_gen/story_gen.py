The Steps Explained
1. In A Zone Of Comfort
In the first step, the protagonist is surrounded by a world known to them, where they are in control of their situation. This world is unchallenging and the protagonist lives a relatively mundane everyday.
2. They Desire Something
The protagonist really wants something. They want to achieve this goal so bad they will go to great lengths to achieve it. However, this desire is out of their reach and throws them out of their comfort zone.
3. Enter An Unfamiliar Situation
In order to achieve this goal or desire the protagonist has to enter unknown territory. They are thrown into a world beyond their control.
4. Adapt To The Situation
The protagonist combines their already established skills with their newly acquired skills to fully adapt to their new surroundings. However, this takes time which can lead to trouble as time is never on their side.
5. Get What They Desired
The one thing they truly wanted is gained but other obstacles follow close behind.
6. Pay A Heavy Price For Winning
When things go too well bad things start to happen. The protagonist wins something but loses another thing. Something important or meaningful to the protagonist has been lost.
7. A Return To Their Familiar Situation
The protagonist returns to their normal world. As a result, they ease back into their zone of comfort, where everything is familiar again.
8. They Have Overall Changed
However, after entering back into their familiar world, the protagonist does not return as the same person. A deep-rooted trait has changed inside them, whether that be a fear they have overcome or a character flaw that they have changed. Although, by the end of the journey the characterâ€™s everyday life has been enriched by their experience.'''
